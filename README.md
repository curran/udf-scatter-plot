Unidirectional Data Flow Scatter Plot Example

Demonstrates patterns around:

 * state management with unidirectional data flow (see `main.js`)
 * hot reloading support (`main.js`)
 * loading data (`loadAndParseCSV.js`)
 * responding to resize (`respondToResize.js`)
 * composing features (`viz.js`)
 * managing a single DOM element (`one.js` - see also [D3 PR: One](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/pull/300))
